# How to get started with OwnCDN

The most convenient way to run OwnCDN in production is as a web-site under IIS. This gives you all the features of IIS, such as running multiple web-sites on the same IP / port, SSL management, etc.

But if you just want to quickly test out OwnCDN without a lot of configuration, you can also just download the .zip files, extract this, and run owncdn.exe from a command line.
