# How to get started with OwnCDN

## Run under IIS

The best way to run OwnCDN **in production** is as a web-site under IIS. This gives you all the features of IIS, such as running multiple web-sites on the same IP / port, SSL management, etc., and it is more performant that routing requests thorugh some kind of reverse proxy.

See [How to install OwnCDN as an IIS web-site](1-how-to-install-owncdn-as-an-iis-web-site.md)

## Run from command line

If you just want to quickly test out OwnCDN without a lot of configuration, you can download the command line version of OwnCDN. This is a self-contained program which requires no install or configuration. Simply download and extract the .zip file, and run owncdn.exe from a command line.
