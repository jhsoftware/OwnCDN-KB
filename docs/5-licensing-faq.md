# Licensing FAQ

### How many licenses do I need?

You need one license for each installed instance of OwnCDN (also if only used for backup / replication target).

<!--
### Can I use multiple licenses on a OwnCDN instance (in order to host more zones)?

No, only one license can be used at a time.

If you need to host more zones, you need to upgrade the license to a larger size.
-->

### What versions/releases are a license is valid for?

1) The current version at the time of purchase (new or upgrade).
2) Any versions (major/minor\*) released within one year after the purchase (see "one year free upgrade protection" below).
3) Any patch (build number\* increase only) released at any time (also beyond the one year), for above versions (see 1 and 2).

\* We use this software version numbering structure:
`<major>.<minor>.<build>`

### Do licenses expire?

No, our licenses are perpetual. A license is valid **forever** for the versions/releases mentioned above.

### Do I have to pay a yearly "maintenance fee"?

No, our licenses are perpetual. They are **not subscriptions**, and there are no recurring fees.

You only pay again if you choose to upgrade to a new version released a year or more after your purchase.

### "One year free upgrade protection"?

With any license purchase (new or upgrade), you receive one year of free upgrade protection.

This entitles you to receive any new version of the software for free, regardless of major or minor update, within a year of the purchase.

### Do licenses need to be "activated"?

Yes, license activation is required.

You can activate either directly in the software (the software contacts our activation server over the Internet), or by copying a link to a browser (one the same or another computer) and then copying back an activation key.

For more on activation, please see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_activation>
