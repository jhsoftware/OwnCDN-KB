# Error Reports

If the unexpected should happen, and OwnCDN crashes, it will attempt to send a notification and to write a detailed error report file to a "_Crash_Reports" folder under the data folder.

The error report file is named "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-######.txt" based on the date and time that the crash happened.

We highly appreciate if you e-mail us such reports along with your notes about what might have led up to the crash so that we can investigate and correct the issue.
